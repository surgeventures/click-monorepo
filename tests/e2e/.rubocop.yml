Layout/AlignParameters:
  EnforcedStyle: with_fixed_indentation

# It's better to align with end keyword than case keyword as aligment to case makes code unreadable
# when assigning case result to variable. In other uses the result is the same.
Layout/CaseIndentation:
  EnforcedStyle: end
  Enabled: true

# This helps to copy the commands and paste them to a Rails console session, since the prompt will
# wait for more input after seeing a dot.
Layout/DotPosition:
  EnforcedStyle: trailing

# This cuts down on the method invokation length and alignment problems when the method name
# changes.
Layout/IndentArray:
  EnforcedStyle: consistent
Layout/IndentHash:
  EnforcedStyle: consistent
Layout/MultilineMethodCallIndentation:
  EnforcedStyle: indented

# This will make the lines shorter, so the line length limit can stay low, and the variables can be
# more descriptive.
Lint/EndAlignment:

# Complexity and length metrics need a slight boost for now due to the number of offenses, this can
# be made more restrictive in the future.

# In services we may have set_X methods that set some instance variables, also accessors might be

# Putting braces around parameters depends heavily on context. There was no one-size-fits-all

# It's easy to spot the modifier use of if/unless but only if the line is short enough.

# There are no performance benefits of using single-quote, and if interpolation is needed, it won't

# Although %w() arrays are easier to add items to, they're worse when one needs to split them into
